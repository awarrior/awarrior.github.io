Stable is a simple word but is not simple.

### Why I choose Github to restart?

Github is an opening platform and easy to push my code/article up to repository using linux. It's a funny tool to use and meets my curiosity. Other blog systems (like blogbus or cnblog) I have tried before do not satisfy me a lot. Without more patience, I'm not willing to give up previous writings although they took me lots of time. 

Also this is a new chance for me to open a new bright door and improve myself. 
As Steve Jobs said, "Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish". I hope I could keep curious to all unknowns and go ahead in the study processing.

### What I will do next?

I would like to record my following study or creative idea in this blog. Have fun!
